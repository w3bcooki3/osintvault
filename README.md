## üöÄ About OSINTVault

OSINTVault is a powerful, client-side, single-page web application meticulously crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed for cybersecurity analysts, threat intelligence professionals, investigators, and enthusiasts, it provides a secure and organized environment to manage every aspect of your Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) operations directly within your browser.

Forget fragmented notes and scattered tools. OSINTVault centralizes your efforts, offering robust features for data collection, analysis, and reporting, all while prioritizing your privacy by storing all data exclusively in your local browser storage.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note: Demo Product & Future Plans**

Please be aware that this version of OSINTVault is a **demonstration product**. It showcases core functionalities and a conceptual design. While it is fully functional and can be used by anyone, it is currently in active development. Your feedback and comments are highly valued and will directly contribute to its evolution!

I am also actively working on a **browser extension** designed to seamlessly integrate with OSINTVault. This extension will make it easier to collect information directly from web pages, store it in a temporary "collection vault," which can then be easily exported and imported into your main OSINTVault application, automatically organizing data within your user-created custom investigation vaults.

## üêû Known Issues

I am continuously working to improve OSINTVault! Here are some known areas currently under development or review:

1.  **Responsiveness Challenges:** Certain parts of the application may not be fully responsive across all device sizes or orientations.
2.  **Share Link Functionality:** The generated share links may not work consistently for all features or data subsets.
3.  **Audit Log Persistence:** Audit logs currently clear on browser refresh. A fix to ensure persistent storage is actively being worked on.
4.  **Global Filter Scope:** The "Quick Actions and Filters" (Pin/Star/Show All) currently apply only to the "Intelligence Vault" tab. Future updates will extend this functionality to all navigation tabs.
5.  **"My Notes" Saving Behavior:** Notes may be unintentionally saved when attempting to create a new note, even if the "Cancel" action is triggered.
6.  **Dork Assistant Notifications:** Certain actions within the "Dork Assistant" may trigger duplicate or multiple toast notifications for a single action.
7.  **Global Search:** Global Search does not work in OSINT Handbook and Docs Section.
